Recalls stored presets in PTZOptics cameras through a web browser.

Limited by the nine presets in most PTZOptics controllers? Get access to all 255 presets in your camera and recall them easily using this controller.

## Installation
1. Create a directory on your computer where you would like to keep the control files.
2. Download .ZIP file and place in directory created in step 1.
3. Extract .ZIP file.
4. Open ptzoptics-web-preset-recalls.html in a code or plain text editor and enter the settings near the top of the file and save.
  * Make sure the editor used does not have smart quotes enabled as this could cause errors.
5. Take screen shots of the different presets and place the images in the directory created in step 1.
  * The names of the files have to match the ones entered in the settings on step 4.
  * It is recommended to resize the images to 300px wide, as many large images can bog down the browser.

7. Click a preset and watch the camera move!
